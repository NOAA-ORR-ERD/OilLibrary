        There are two distinct sets of distillation cut data in the EC
        spreadsheet. They are:
        - Boiling Point: Distribution, Temperature (C).  Here the labels are
                         percent values representing the fraction boiled off,
                         and the data is the temperature at which the
                         fractional value occurs.
        - Boiling Point: Cumulative Weight Fraction (%).  Here the labels are
                         temperatures (C) values, and the data is the fraction
                         that is boiled off at that temperature.

        We will try to get both sets of data and then merge them if possible.
        Most oils will have either one set or the other, not both.
        Dimensional parameters are simply (weathering).
